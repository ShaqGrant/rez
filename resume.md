### Summary
I'm a young programmer from Kingston, Jamaica. I'm currently pursuing a BSc in Computer Science at UWI and I'm looking for new opportunities to expand my arsenal of skills. Having been exposed to a variety of programming concepts at UWI has broadened my experience but you'll find me most at home devising creative ways to solve new problems.
