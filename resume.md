### Summary

I am a software developer from Kingston, Jamaica. I am currently pursing a BSc in Computer Science at the University of the West Indies and I'm looking for new opportunities. Having been exposed to a variety of programming aspects has broadened my experience, but you'll find me most at home developing software. I have a passion for network security and developing software, especially games. Consistency and clear communication have always been very important to me and I'm a quick learner who is always eager to pick up new technologies.
